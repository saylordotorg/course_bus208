**Unit 1: What Is Management?** <span id="1"></span> 
*In this introductory unit, you will begin your exploration of the
practice of management. In human society there has always been a need
for some degree of management in order to organize the efforts of
individuals for the common (and individual) good. Even in very primitive
times, gathering food, protecting against predators, and caring for the
young required humans to coordinate and organize in order to achieve
common goals.*  
  
 *Put simply, the term* management *refers to the coordination of work
activities through and with other people to accomplish the goals of an
organization. In this unit, you will explore the various functions of
management. Management involves not only coordination, but also
planning, organizing, leading, and controlling. Over the years, the
common definition of management has become less specific, as managerial
functions have come to include staffing, directing, and reporting. In
modern companies, there are fewer layers of management, as today’s
organizations rely instead on the delegation of responsibilities and
authority in order to achieve goals. As a result, today’s managers now
speak in terms of “leading” or “guiding” people, rather than giving
instructions for every action.*  
  
 *Management is both an art and a science, and ultimately you will need
more than one course on management to fully develop your own management
ability. Still, even if you have no aspirations to manage a team, you
may need to lead projects, manage committees, and/or interact with
managers. Understanding what makes a good manager is one of the biggest
factors in the success of an organization and its employees.*
