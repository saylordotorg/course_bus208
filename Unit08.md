**Unit 8: Decision-Making** <span id="8"></span> 
*The essential function of a manager is to make decisions.
Decision-making is about making choices between or among alternatives in
order to advance toward a goal or objective. In our personal lives,
decision-making can involve determining many things, such as where we
live, what foods we eat, and who our friends are. In business,
decision-making can revolve around the products and services that a
company offers, the markets it serves, the people it hires, and so
on.*  
 *   
 In this unit, we will look at the decision-making process, paying close
attention to some of the latest research on what is commonly referred to
as “the art of choosing.” You will learn how decision-making involves
elements of both logic and emotion; after all, we are all human, and
emotion often affects how we choose. *

**8.1.1 Case Study: B. Ebbers Creates Biased Decision-Making at
WorldCom** <span id="8.1.1"></span>

    Section 11.1”**

    (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: Read this textbook excerpt, which includes a case
    study featuring the story of Bernard Ebbers. As the CEO and top
    manager of a *Fortune 500* company called WorldCom, Mr. Ebbers was
    frequently identified as a difficult man to work for – to the extent
    that managers working for him often avoided telling him vital
    information that might have shaped how he made executive decisions.
    Further adding to the severity of this systemic communication
    breakdown, Mr. Ebbers was extremely resistant to change – a quality
    that produces failures in management. Use this case as a
    foundational analysis of all the information presented in Unit 8 of
    this course. In addition, you may want to review this case again
    after completing this unit’s readings in order to consider how the
    outcomes at WorldCom might have been prevented.
