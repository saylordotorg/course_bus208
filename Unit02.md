**Unit 2: Historical Development and Globalization** <span
id="2"></span> 
*The more complex an organization and its operations, the more active a
role management plays. Successful management imposes a degree of order
and discipline so that work can be accomplished expeditiously, no matter
what the size of the organization, how many countries it operates in, or
how much of its work is performed virtually.*  
     
 *In this unit, you will explore various theories of management
throughout history, paying close attention to Frederick Winslow Taylor’s
scientific management theory, which was widely practiced in the
industrial age of the 20<sup>th</sup> century. You will also take stock
of more contemporary, 21<sup>st</sup>-century approaches to management,
which tend to be better suited to organizations in knowledge-based
industries (as opposed to those in manufacturing). Finally, you will
begin to examine management from a global perspective.*

    possible for a company to use one or the other? As you read about
    the advancement of management theories, consider the approaches used
    in your own organization, or another contemporary organization. Can

    theories fit in with his ability to come up with innovative
    inventions? Recognizing the fact that Taylor’s theories may have
    been misunderstood or misapplied, do you see any modern applications
    and uses for his methods? Are any of these methods being used in

    this approach, or do you/they use a more scientific and structured
    method? In your experience, which approach has proven to be more
    effective? How do Mintzberg’s management approaches complement or
