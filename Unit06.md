**Unit 6: Human Resource Management** <span id="6"></span> 
“Business – real business – isn’t about money. It’s about people. You
have to know and understand people.”  
           – André Meyer  
    
 *The late André Meyer was a financier who collaborated with
corporations in countries around the world. He served as an advisor to
leaders of state and worked as the head of the investment-banking firm
Lazard Frères. Despite the fact that his career was entirely focused on
raising capital and profits, Meyer saw people – including the employees
of a company – as the most important aspect of business success. Meyer’s
belief still resonates in today’s business world. Indeed, knowing how to
implement effective and strategic human resource management is a crucial
skill for any manager.*  
    
 *Human resource management (HRM) exists in many forms. We often think
about Human Resources as the company department that handles paychecks
and benefits, or the office an employee visits when he or she encounters
a problem such as harassment or discrimination. However, HRM oversees
many more responsibilities than these traditional tasks. Perhaps the
most important change in the practice of HRM has occurred within the
recruiting of top-quality employees for a firm. Historically, HR staff,
rather than company managers, have recruited and sifted through
applications to find candidates to interview for positions at a company.
But HR department staff often lack the knowledge necessary to
effectively screen for many newer, more technical positions – a
situation in which a manager’s expertise and input greatly benefit the
hiring process.*  
    
 *In the 21<sup>st</sup> century, as companies work harder to attract
and recruit talent, modern HRM is developing a more strategic nature.
For example, a top HR executive today will most likely report directly
to the CEO and play an integral role in executing a company’s strategy.
To stay competitive, today’s managers must also work in conjunction with
HR to be able to quickly and reliably identify the skill sets and
personal characteristics that are needed to increase productivity in a
company’s present and future workforce. *

    employees.

     Instructions: Read this article and consider the idea that
    employees should be viewed in the same way that companies view
    supply-chain management principles. Do you think it is inevitable
    that employees will move from one company to another throughout
    their careers? Should companies cultivate more of their employees
    with the hope that good talent will stay with and will benefit the
    organization? If a company views employees as commodities, will such
    a view discourage workers from commitment and dedication to the
    organization?  
      
     Reading this article and answering the questions above should take
    approximately 15 minutes.
