**Unit 3: Organizational Culture, Diversity, and Ethics** <span
id="3"></span> 
*In this unit, you will look at organizational culture and how it
provides a company with its own workplace climate and personality.
Organizational culture includes attitudes, values, and work styles
which, when managed properly, can lead to a highly productive
workforce.*  
    
 *A diverse workforce brings together people from different backgrounds.
Each individual brings his or her own experiences and expertise to the
table. The blending of these backgrounds can enhance productivity by
allowing for the free flow of new ideas and creativity. This unit will
explore the importance of a diverse workforce, and how managers can make
the most of their employees’ individual knowledge and approaches in
order to reach corporate goals.*  
    
 *Management sets the tone not only for a corporate climate; it also
sets the standard for personal behavior. In this unit you will also
learn about the importance of ethics – that is, “doing what is right” or
“doing the right thing.” In light of recent major business scandals
borne out of unethical behavior, almost all business schools have
devoted aspects of their curricula to the study of ethics. In order to
understand how to apply ethics to different circumstances, you must
understand how ethics can vary based on differences in society, culture,
and politics. There are a number of different philosophies purporting to
explain how to apply ethics to decision-making, but none of them are
absolute. However, understanding these various philosophies can help you
reach workplace decisions that are more ethically grounded.*  
    
 *This unit will conclude with an exploration of business ethics in the
modern-day workplace environment. An organization and its managers have
duties – including legal and ethical responsibilities – that they must
uphold as part of their service to their stakeholders, including
investors, vendors, employees, and the communities in which the
organization operates. *
