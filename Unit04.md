**Unit 4: Unit 4: Leadership and Teams** <span id="4"></span> 
*Throughout this course, we define managers as people who work with and
through other people to accomplish the goals of an organization. One
important managerial function we have not yet touched upon is*
motivation*, or the ability to persuade and inspire others to commit to
an organization and its goals. A good leader must be a good manager if
he or she wishes to get a lot accomplished. In order to get work done,
managers must often foster collaboration between employees so that
individuals with different skills from different parts of a company can
successfully contribute to projects. The concept of collaboration has
evolved into the practice of creating teams comprising specific
individuals with complementary skills who gather around a common
purpose. This purpose might include accomplishing a specific task,
addressing a particular problem, revising an internal company process,
etc. *  
  
 *The term* team*is used so frequently today that the meaning of this
concept is often diluted. Still, contemporary companies and
organizations rely on the efforts of different kinds of teams, and many
times an organization will pull together teams with members scattered
over multiple geographic locations - including, even, multiple
countries - in an effort to bring together the skills and competencies
needed to address a significant task.*  
  
 *One of the key roles of any manager is to establish the goals and
purposes of a team and to select appropriate team members. From there,
the team will - more or less independently - work to accomplish its
purpose under the supervision of a leader, who must organize and manage
the team effectively.*  
  
 *What does a successful team look like? Would you be surprised to know
that the best teams actually experience conflicts? In fact, conflict can
be a productive force capable of generating new ideas and multiple
options for consideration. The key is to avoid letting professional
conflict spill over into personal relationships, a task that is
difficult to achieve without careful study and practice. In this unit,
you will look at the different stages of group development in order to
learn how to create a successful team and avoid the common pitfalls of
working with a team. *

    (PDF)  
      
     Instructions: Read this textbook excerpt, which addresses the
    meaning of power. Power ultimately can be considered to be one’s
    ability to influence others, a skill that all managers need to
    possess, regardless of their level of management within an
    organization. This reading also discusses the negative and positive
    consequences of power as it is used by managers.

    (PDF)  
      
     Instructions: Read this textbook excerpt, which discusses and
    defines different types of power. As you are learning about these
    different types of power, keep in mind that all managers have a
    dominant style of power – that is, a style they are most comfortable
    with. But if a manager relies only on utilizing one type of power,
    he or she may find him- or herself in situations in which his or her
    management loses some of its effectiveness. A good manager has to
    develop an understanding of all types of power, and then use this
    understanding to shape how he or she will respond within any given
    situation.

    (PDF)  
      
     Instructions: Read this textbook excerpt, which discusses how to
    interpret, manage, and prioritize organizational politics. As you
    will see, lack of opportunity often leads to feelings of contempt
    and jealousy in the workplace. One example provided in this reading
    is the absence of upward mobility within a given company. If
    employees believe there is an absence of these opportunities, they
    in turn may perceive the organization as being overly political.
    This reading offers you strategies to help minimize the politics
    within your organization and promote a more harmonious
    environment.

    (PDF)  
      
     Instructions: Read this textbook excerpt, which emphasizes the
    benefits of working towards improving internal and external social
    networking. In today's management environment, no one should
    overlook or underestimate the power of social networking. As you
    read, focus on the discussion of social networking as it applies to
    management, as well as the reading’s analysis of social networking’s
    influence on an organization’s ability to remain relevant within the
    marketplace.

    (PDF)  
      
     Instructions: Read this textbook excerpt, which examines how ethics
    and culture impact power. Having power without the ability to
    exercise some level of control will inevitably lead to a variety of
    ethical challenges. This potential for the misuse of power increases
    significantly when a company makes the decision to conduct business
    globally. Regardless of the setting and field in which a business
    operates, an organization should consider how power is harnessed and
    applied, and how it can be used to minimize or eliminate cultural or
    ethical challenges.

    (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: Read this textbook excerpt, which reviews the tools
    necessary to create a thriving work environment. Earlier in this
    course, you were introduced to the concept of social networking and
    its impact on an organization’s ability to remain competitive and
    relevant. As you read this section’s real-life application of social
    networking, keep in mind that before you can actually apply any of
    these concepts in an organizational setting, you have to first
    understand how these concepts impact you individually. Too often
    individuals mismanage themselves and prematurely claim to possess
    the tools needed to properly manage strategic business environments.
    Throughout your studies in this course, you should be applying
    important concepts to your own business studies and analyzing how
    you can use this information to achieve individual success in
    management.  
        
     Reading this textbook excerpt and completing the exercises should

     Instructions: Read this textbook excerpt, which discusses the
    concept of teamwork through an analysis of GE’s employee practices.

    (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: Read this textbook excerpt, which discusses both
    formal and informal group dynamics. Pay particular attention to the
    foundational model of team and group development. There are a number
    of other models for team development available, but the Tuckman
    model is one of the most popular in today’s business world. This
    reading also introduces a more radical approach to understanding
    groups and teams – known as *punctuated equilibrium*. This model of
    team-building is based on the idea that teams go through periods of
    stability and periods of rapid change. What happens during these
    alternating periods is what makes this approach to managing teams so
    unique.
