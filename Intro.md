Course Syllabus for "BUS208: Principles of Management"
------------------------------------------------------

*Management* refers to the organization and coordination of work to
produce a desired result. A manager is a person who practices management
by working with and through people in order to accomplish his or her
organization’s goals. When you think of the term *manager*, you may be
imagining your supervisor as he or she hires and terminates employees
and makes major decisions above your authority. However, although you
may not view yourself in this way, you yourself may also be a manager.
In fact, many of us practice management skills in the workplace every
day. You may have a team of employees that you manage, or lead a project
that requires management strategy, or demonstrate leadership qualities
among your peers. These are all scenarios that require you to apply the
principles of management. In this course, you will learn to recognize
the characteristics of proper management by identifying what successful
managers do and how they do it. Understanding how managers work is just
as beneficial for the subordinate employee as it is for the manager.
This course is designed to teach you the fundamentals of management as
they are practiced today. Management began to materialize as a practice
during the Industrial Revolution, as large corporations began to emerge
in the late 19<sup>th</sup> century and developed and expanded into the
early 20<sup>th</sup> century. Many large corporations during the early
1900s did not have any competition and thus dominated their industries.
At the time, each employee was seen as a cog in a wheel – a useful yet
expendable part of a business’s operation. But the development of the
assembly line in the 1910s and 1920s and the attendant automation of
production processes drove changes in management strategy and required
businesses to rethink how they managed their resources (i.e. their
people, finances, capital, and tangible assets). The fundamental
concepts of modern management were famously explored by Frederick
Winslow Taylor, an American engineer who wrote *The Principles of
Scientific Management*. Published in 1911 and based on research
conducted by Taylor, the book’s analysis aimed to couple the efficiency
needs of a business with the specialized talents of its employees.
Taylor’s conclusion was that employees are almost always driven by the
desire to earn money. Because businesses at the time had very little
production capacity, the principles of management aimed toward driving
sales by enticing employees with more money for increased production. As
such, modern management’s focus was on producing as much product as
possible to meet consumer demand for goods and services. By the late
20<sup>th</sup> century, automation, higher educational levels, and the
push for speed had changed management practices, and businesses had by
and large moved away from a top-down, centralized direction style and
toward leaner organization with less regimentation. Nevertheless,
Taylor’s theories and their lessons remain important as a foundation for
understanding how to manage large projects that require a variety of
skills and a large number of workers. This course will illustrate the
ways in which the practice of management evolves as firms grow in size.
Historically, middle managers have served as so-called “gatekeepers” who
collect, analyze, and pass information up and down the management chain
within an organization. But two recent developments at the turn of the
21<sup>st</sup> century – namely, low-cost data manipulation in
computers and the emergence of widespread, real-time communication (in
the forms of inexpensive, long-distance global calling, email, text
messaging, and social media) – have reduced the need for these
middle-manager gatekeepers, and companies have eliminated thousands of
such positions. The goal? To speed the flow of information and
decision-making and reduce the number of layers that separate the
customer from the leadership of an organization. This course is based
upon the idea that the essential purpose of a business is to produce
products and services in order to meet the needs and wants of the
marketplace. A manager marshals an organization’s resources (its people,
finances, facilities, and equipment) toward this fundamental goal. In
this course, you will explore the tasks that today’s managers perform
and delve into the key knowledge areas that managers need to master in
order to run successful and profitable businesses. **This course

### Course Information

**Welcome to BUS208: Principles of Management.** Below, please find some
general information about this course and its requirements.  
  
 **Course Designers:** Johnny Jackson, MBA, MHRM, Peter Lucash, Debbie
Soden, and Melinda Salzer  
    
 **Primary Resources:** This course uses a range of different free,
online educational materials, with primary use of the following online
textbooks:  

-   *Exploring Business*
-   *Principles of Management*
-   *Organizational Behavior*

Requirements for Completion: In order to complete this course, you will
need to work through each unit and all of its assigned materials. Each
unit provides strategic information that builds and supports your
understanding of the principles of management. It is very important that
you take thorough notes as you work through this course, and that you
use these notes to support your critical analysis of the content you are
reading or viewing. You also will need to complete:  

-   The Unit Assessments
-   The BUS208 Discussion Forum Activities
-   The Final Exam

Note that you will only receive an official grade on your Final Exam. In
order to pass this course, you will need to earn a 70% or higher on the
Final Exam. Your score on the exam will be tabulated as soon as you
complete it. If you do not pass the exam, you may take it again.  
    
 **Time Commitment:** This course should take you approximately 106
hours to complete. Each unit includes a time advisory that lists the
amount of time you are expected to spend on each unit and subunit. These
time advisories should help you plan your time accordingly. It may be
useful to you to take a look at these time advisories and determine how
much time you have over the next few weeks to complete each unit, and
then to set goals for yourself. For example, Unit 1 should take you
approximately 15 hours to complete. To make the process of completing
Unit 1 manageable, you should block out time over the course of a
specified period (e.g., a calendar week) and then schedule each day
within that period for work on a specific subunit. For example, you may
decide to complete Subunit 1.1 (a total of 5 hours) on Monday night,
half of Subunit 1.2 (about 2.5 hours) on Tuesday night, the rest of
Subunit 1.2 (another 2.25 hours) on Wednesday night, etc.

presented; also note that information pulled from these videos will
appear on your Final Exam. As with the reading assignments in this
course, it will be useful for you to consult your notes on the videos as
a form of review prior to attempting the Final Exam.
