**Unit 5: Managing Employees: Motivation, Empowerment, and Conflict
Resolution** <span id="5"></span> 
*One of your most important functions as a manager is motivating your
employees to do their best while attempting to meet corporate goals.
When employees are motivated, they will seek out ways to improve their
work production and maximize their performance.* *By giving employees
the freedom to act on their own knowledge and skills, you will encourage
them to ultimately be more productive for the company by fully utilizing
their skill sets and, in the process, growing as professionals.*  
  
 *Every work environment encompasses a wide variety of personalities and
professional styles. As a result, conflicts are sure to arise. Effective
managers know how to address a conflict when it arises and how to
frequently work in concert with others to ensure a speedy resolution. *

    (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: Read this textbook excerpt, which provides an
    excellent glimpse into the concept of motivation by examining the
    company Zappos and the methods Zappos uses to identify and motivate
    effective contributors to the company’s organizational success. Once
    an employee’s initial training is complete, Zappos offers that
    employee a significant financial payment to quit his or her new job.
    That's right - after training is complete, Zappos will pay an
    employee to leave the company if he or she so chooses. By
    implementing this unusual practice, Zappos attempts to create a
    strategic motivational environment in which all the people who work
    for the company have a strong desire to be there.
