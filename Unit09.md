**Unit 9: Organization Structure, Change, and the Future of Management**
<span id="9"></span> 
*For a company to be effective and profitable, a strong organizational
structure must be in place. This structure provides a framework from
which all goals are set and helps individuals and departments know where
they fit within the company’s organization. *
